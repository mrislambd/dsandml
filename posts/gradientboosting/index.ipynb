        "\n",
        "1.  **Independence of Features**: Gradient Boosting assumes that the\n",
        "    features are independent. Correlated features can lead to\n",
        "    overfitting.\n",
        "2.  **Weak Learners**: It assumes that weak learners, typically shallow\n",
        "    decision trees, are adequate for capturing the patterns in the data,\n",
        "    though overly complex learners may lead to overfitting.\n",
        "3.  **Additive Model**: The model is additive, meaning it combines weak\n",
        "    learners to improve performance. This makes it sensitive to noisy\n",
        "    data, as adding too many learners might lead to overfitting.\n",
        "\n",
        "## When to Use Gradient Boosting?\n",
        "\n",
        "Gradient Boosting is ideal in the following scenarios:\n",
        "\n",
        "-   **High Predictive Power**: When accuracy is a top priority, Gradient\n",
        "    Boosting often outperforms simpler algorithms like linear regression\n",
        "    or basic decision trees.  \n",
        "-   **Complex Datasets**: It works well with datasets that have complex\n",
        "    patterns, non-linear relationships, or multiple feature\n",
        "    interactions.  \n",
        "-   **Feature Engineering**: It is less reliant on extensive feature\n",
        "    engineering because decision trees are capable of handling mixed\n",
        "    types of features (numerical and categorical) and automatically\n",
        "    learning interactions.  \n",
        "-   **Imbalanced Data**: Gradient Boosting can handle class imbalances\n",
        "    by tuning the loss function, making it suitable for classification\n",
        "    tasks like fraud detection.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, due to its complexity, Gradient Boosting can be computationally\n",
        "expensive, so it’s less ideal for very large datasets or real-time\n",
